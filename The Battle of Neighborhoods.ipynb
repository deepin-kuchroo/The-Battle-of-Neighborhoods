A csv file was created which will be read in order to create a dataframe and its mapping. The csv file 'mh_neigh_data.csv' has the following below data structure. The file will be directly read to the Jupiter Notebook for convenience and space savings. The clustering of neighborhoods and mapping will be shown however.

The csv file \"nnnn.csv\" had the following below structure. An algorythm was used to create all the geodata using Nominatim, as shown in section 3.0. The actual algorythm coding may be shown in 'markdown' mode becasues it takes time to run. With the use of geolocator = Nominatim() , it was possible to determine the latitude and longiude for the subway metro locations as well as for the geodata for each rental place listed. The loop algorythms used are shown in the execution of data in section 3.0 \"Great_circle\" function from geolocator was used to calculate distances between two points , as in the case to calculate average rent price for units around each subway station and at 1.6 km radius. Foursquare is used to find the avenues at Manhattan neighborhoods in general and a cluster is created to later be able to search for the venues depending of the location shown."
